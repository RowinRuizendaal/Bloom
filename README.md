## :rocket: Purpose of Project

The reason the client started this project is that she has been personally involved in this disease. The client's mother has had breast cancer. She then started to talk a lot with her mother about the process afterward. However, there is still little instruction/approach to be found after the treatment project. It is clear during the treatment process what the approach is, but after that, it stops. Not much is known about that yet. That is why Eva got the idea to investigate this.

## Goal of the application

The purpose of this application is to connect people who have had or still have cancer. These people can tell their story together or find support from other users. The users can therefore find a 'buddy' with this app. The user can also indicate in the app what type of cancer they have had and this means that these people are matched based on the type of cancer.



## :heart_eyes: Concept
### What's it?
**Bloom** is an application to connect people with each other who have had or still have cancer, these people can tell share their thought and opinions with others.

### Core feature/user scenario's
- As a user, I want information on relevant topics, so that I know what to expect after the treatment process.
- As a user, I want 1 on 1 contact with fellow sufferers, so that I can reflect on my experiences and strengthen my coping strategies.



## :1234: Data  
We used Mongoose data schemas to create schemas before we insert the data.
### User schema
```js
{
  firstName: String,
  surName: String,
  emailAddress: String,
  password: String,
  birthDate: String,
  town: String,
  gender: String,
  typeIllness: String,
  profileAvatar: String,
  about: String,
}

```
